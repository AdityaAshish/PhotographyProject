    <h2> Welcome! This is my Photography Website!
    </h2>
    <p>While many people do not give photography respect as an art form and as a profession, I, along with many others believe that photography, just like any other art form is important.</p>

            <h3>These are some photos I took representing the beauty of Mother Nature, it warms my heart seeing such beauty. All living creatures are products of Nature and are connected to it in one way or the other.</h3>

            <h3> This is another photo taken by me, it shows a beautiful sunset. I feel like the sky should not be seen as a roof over our heads, but more like encouragement to expand the human race into space, as it is so vast and blue, when looking at it, one can only be curious as to what lies above it. </h3>
